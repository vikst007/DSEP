Medication management typically involves medications to control blood pressure, treat infections, and manage underlying causes of kidney damage. Dialysis is a procedure that helps filter waste and excess fluids from the blood when the kidneys are unable to do so. In severe cases, a kidney transplant may be necessary to replace the damaged kidneys with a healthy donor organ.

- **By End-User**: The market can also be segmented by end-user, with categories including hospitals, specialty clinics, and ambulatory surgical centers. Hospitals are often the primary point of care for patients with Cortical Necrosis, providing emergency treatment, inpatient care, and specialized medical services. Specialty clinics may offer more focused and specialized care for patients with kidney-related conditions, while ambulatory surgical centers provide outpatient procedures and treatments for milder cases of Cortical Necrosis.
