**Segments**

- By Type: The market can be segmented into primary and secondary Neonatal Hypoxic-Ischemic Encephalopathy (HIE). Primary HIE occurs during or shortly after birth due to reduced oxygen supply to the brain. Secondary HIE develops after the initial insult and can be a result of various factors such as inflammation or seizures.
- By Treatment: Treatment options for Neonatal HIE include therapeutic hypothermia, neuroprotective agents, supportive care, and stem cell therapy. Therapeutic hypothermia is considered the standard of care in managing neonates with HIE. Neuroprotective agents aim to minimize brain injury, while supportive care involves managing symptoms and providing essential support. Stem cell therapy is an emerging area that holds promise in repairing damaged brain tissue.
