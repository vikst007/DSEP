**Segments**

- By Process Type: Pressure Die Casting, Vacuum Die Casting, Squeeze Die Casting
- By Alloy Type: Aluminum-Copper, Aluminum-Silicon, Aluminum-Magnesium
- By End-Use Industry: Automotive, Aerospace, Electronics, Machinery, Others

The aluminum die casting market is segmented based on process type, alloy type, and end-use industry. In terms of process type, pressure die casting is the most commonly used method. Pressure die casting ensures high productivity with excellent surface finish and dimensional accuracy. Vacuum die casting, on the other hand, is preferred for complex and thin-walled parts where air entrapment is a concern. Squeeze die casting, though less common, is used for applications requiring high integrity and dimensional stability. Moving on to alloy types, aluminum-silicon alloy is extensively used due to its good fluidity, corrosion resistance, and high mechanical properties. Aluminum-copper alloy provides excellent strength, wear resistance, and thermal conductivity, suitable for aerospace and automotive applications. Aluminum-magnesium alloy offers lightweight properties and good strength, making it ideal for electronic components and consumer goods. Finally, the end-use industries for aluminum die casting include automotive, aerospace, electronics, machinery, and others.
