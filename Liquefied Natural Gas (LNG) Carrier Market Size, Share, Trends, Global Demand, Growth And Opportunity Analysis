**Segments**

- **Vessel Type:** The LNG carrier market can be segmented based on vessel type into Moss Type, Membrane Type, and Self-supporting Prismatic Type. Each vessel type has its unique design and construction, catering to specific needs in the transportation of liquefied natural gas. The Moss Type vessels are characterized by their spherical tanks, providing strength and durability. Membrane Type carriers have a higher cargo capacity due to their advanced insulation systems, making them efficient for long-distance transportation. Self-supporting Prismatic Type carriers are known for their square or rectangular tanks, offering a balance between capacity and flexibility in operations.

- **Capacity:** Another crucial segmentation factor in the LNG carrier market is based on capacity, categorized into Small Scale (1,000-40,000 cubic meters), Mid-Scale (40,000-79,999 cubic meters), and Large Scale (80,000-180,000 cubic meters). Small-scale LNG carriers are ideal for short-distance transportation and supply to remote locations. Mid-scale carriers cater to medium-sized LNG demands, offering versatility in routes and destinations. Large-scale carriers are designed for long-haul voyages and mega LNG projects, providing significant economies of scale and efficiency gains.
