**Segments**

- **Type**: Biofungicides for soil treatment are segmented based on type into bacterial biofungicides, fungal biofungicides, and viral biofungicides. Bacterial biofungicides are live bacteria that suppress the growth of harmful soil-borne pathogens. Fungal biofungicides, on the other hand, use beneficial fungi to combat plant diseases. Viral biofungicides utilize viruses that infect and kill specific disease-causing pathogens, providing an environmentally friendly solution to soil treatment.

- **Crop Type**: Another important segmentation factor is the crop type for which biofungicides are used. Different crops may require specific types of biofungicides for effective soil treatment. Companies offer specialized biofungicides tailored to the needs of various crops such as cereals, fruits, vegetables, and pulses. This segmentation ensures that farmers can choose the most suitable biofungicide for their specific crop requirements.

- **Application Method**: The application method of biofungicides in soil treatment is also a significant segment. Biofungicides can be applied through various methods such as soil drenching, seed treatment, foliar spray, and root dipping. Each application method has its advantages and is chosen based on factors like crop type, disease severity, and effectiveness of the biofungicide. Farmers select the application method that best suits their farming practices and requirements.

**Market Players**
