**Segments**

- By Phase: The asteroid mining market can be segmented based on the phase which includes prospecting, exploration, and operation. Prospectors are responsible for identifying potential asteroids with valuable resources, while the exploration phase involves detailed analysis and planning for extraction. The operation phase encompasses the actual mining process of extracting resources from asteroids.

- By Asteroid Type: Another important segmentation criterion is the type of asteroids being mined. Different asteroids contain varying compositions of resources such as water, metals, and rare earth minerals. C-type asteroids are known to be rich in water, while M-type asteroids are often abundant in metals like iron, nickel, and cobalt. S-type asteroids, on the other hand, are composed of silicate materials like oxides and silicates.

- By Application: The market for asteroid mining can also be segmented by application, including resource utilization, space exploration, and construction. Resource utilization involves utilizing extracted materials for energy production, manufacturing, and other industrial purposes. Space exploration involves using mined resources for the development of space habitats or for fueling spacecraft. Construction applications involve utilizing asteroid resources for building structures in space or on other celestial bodies.
