Market Definition

Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA) is a channel access method used in communication systems to allocate distinct time slots to multiple users on a shared frequency channel. This technology ensures efficient utilization of bandwidth by dividing the signal into time segments, allowing multiple users to transmit data sequentially. TDMA has been a cornerstone in various communication systems, including 2G and 3G cellular networks, satellite communications, and digital broadcasting. Its reliability, cost-effectiveness, and ability to manage multiple users simultaneously make it a significant player in the telecommunications sector.
