Despite the positive growth prospects, the herbal tea market faces some challenges that could hinder its development. One of the key challenges is the fluctuations in raw material prices, particularly for rare and exotic herbs used in herbal tea blends. These price fluctuations can impact the overall production costs for market players, affecting pricing strategies and profit margins. Additionally, stringent regulations and quality standards in different regions can pose compliance challenges for market players operating on a global scale.

In conclusion, the global herbal tea market is poised for significant growth driven by increasing consumer awareness, health benefits, product innovation, and expanding distribution channels.
