**Segments**

- **Night Vision System**:
The night vision system market is experiencing significant growth due to the rising demand for enhanced visibility and safety features in vehicles. This system allows drivers to have better visibility in low-light conditions, reducing the risk of accidents. The market for night vision systems is segmented into active and passive systems. Active systems use infrared light to illuminate the road ahead, while passive systems rely on ambient light sources like headlights. The active night vision system segment is expected to witness substantial growth, driven by the increasing adoption of advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) in vehicles.

- **Driver Monitoring System**:
The driver monitoring system market is also witnessing rapid expansion as automotive manufacturers focus on improving road safety and driver awareness. This system uses technology such as cameras and sensors to monitor the driver's attentiveness and alertness while driving. The market for driver monitoring systems is segmented into vision-based and physiological measurement-based systems. Vision-based systems track the driver's eye movements and facial expressions, while physiological measurement-based systems monitor factors like heart rate and fatigue levels. The implementation of stringent safety regulations and the integration of driver monitoring systems into autonomous vehicles are driving the growth of this market.
