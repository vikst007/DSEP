**Segments**

- **Carrier Type:** The LNG carrier market can be segmented based on carrier type into membrane type LNG carrier, moss type LNG carrier, and others. Membrane type LNG carriers are designed with a continuous layer of insulation supported by a primary and secondary membrane under the hull. Moss type LNG carriers, on the other hand, have spherical tanks for storing LNG at low temperatures. Each type has its advantages and is chosen based on factors such as capacity, efficiency, and cost.

- **Capacity:** Another crucial segmentation factor is the capacity of LNG carriers. The market offers a range of carrier sizes, from small-scale carriers with capacities of less than 30,000 cubic meters to large-scale carriers with capacities exceeding 200,000 cubic meters. The choice of capacity depends on the volume of LNG to be transported, trade routes, infrastructure capabilities, and operational efficiency considerations.

- **Technology:** The technology segment includes aspects like propulsion systems, cargo containment systems, and onboard equipment. Advancements in technology have led to the development of more efficient propulsion systems such as slow-speed diesel engines, steam turbines, and electric propulsion. Cargo containment systems play a vital role in maintaining the integrity and safety of LNG during transportation. Onboard equipment such as reliquefaction units, gas combustion units, and boil-off gas handling systems contribute to the overall operational efficiency of LNG carriers.
