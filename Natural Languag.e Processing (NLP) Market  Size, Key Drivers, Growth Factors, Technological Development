**Segments**

- **Technology**: This segment includes machine learning, natural language understanding, and automatic summarization among others. Machine learning plays a crucial role in NLP by enabling systems to learn from data and improve their performance without being explicitly programmed. Natural language understanding helps computers comprehend human language, enabling interactions like chatbots and virtual assistants. Automatic summarization allows systems to condense large bodies of text into shorter versions for easier understanding.

- **Application**: The application segment covers areas such as sentiment analysis, voice recognition, and language translation. Sentiment analysis involves the use of NLP to determine the sentiment or emotional tone behind a piece of text, which is valuable for businesses in gauging customer feedback or market trends. Voice recognition technology enables machines to understand and respond to spoken language, powering applications like voice assistants. Language translation services leverage NLP to translate text or speech from one language to another, facilitating global communication and accessibility.

- **Deployment**: This segment includes cloud-based and on-premises deployments. Cloud-based deployment offers scalability, flexibility, and cost-effectiveness as NLP solutions are hosted and maintained by external providers. On-premises deployment, on the other hand, provides organizations with greater control over their data and processes, making it suitable for industries with strict security and compliance requirements.
