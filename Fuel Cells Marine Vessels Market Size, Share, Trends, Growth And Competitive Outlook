**Segments**

- Based on fuel type, the fuel cells marine vessels market can be segmented into hydrogen, ammonia, and others. Hydrogen fuel cells are gaining popularity in the maritime industry due to their clean energy production and efficient operation. Ammonia is also being explored as a potential fuel option for marine vessels as it is a carbon-neutral fuel that can be produced from renewable sources. Other fuel types include methanol, biofuels, and hybrid systems that offer flexibility in choosing the most suitable fuel for a specific vessel's requirements.

- On the basis of vessel type, the market can be categorized into passenger ships, cargo ships, tugboats, and others. Passenger ships are increasingly adopting fuel cell technology to meet stringent emissions regulations and provide a sustainable travel experience for passengers. Cargo ships are also turning towards fuel cells to reduce their environmental footprint and comply with international environmental standards. Tugboats, known for their frequent maneuvering and idling, can benefit from fuel cells' quick response and efficient power generation.

- By power range, the fuel cells marine vessels market can be divided into less than 200 kW, 200-400 kW, and more than 400 kW. Smaller vessels such as yachts and leisure boats typically require power outputs of less than 200 kW, making them ideal candidates for smaller fuel cell systems. Larger vessels like ferries and container ships may need power ranges between 200-400 kW or even higher, depending on their size and operational requirements. The versatility of fuel cell technology allows for scalability to meet varying power demands across different vessel types.
