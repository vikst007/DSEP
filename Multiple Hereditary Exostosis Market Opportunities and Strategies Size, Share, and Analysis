**Segments**

- Based on type, the multiple hereditary exostosis market can be segmented into diaphyseal aclasis and metaphyseal aclasis. Diaphyseal aclasis affects long bones, particularly the forearm, lower leg, and upper arm. Metaphyseal aclasis, on the other hand, is characterized by the abnormal growth of bones at the metaphyseal region. These different types of exostoses can impact treatment strategies and patient outcomes.
- On the basis of end-users, the market for multiple hereditary exostosis can be categorized into hospitals, specialty clinics, and ambulatory surgical centers. Each of these end-users plays a crucial role in the diagnosis, treatment, and long-term management of patients with multiple hereditary exostosis.
