**Segments**

- **Procedure Type:** The neurosurgery market can be segmented based on the type of procedures such as minimally invasive surgeries, open neurosurgeries, and neuroendoscopy procedures. Minimally invasive surgeries are gaining popularity due to reduced risks, shorter recovery times, and lesser post-operative complications. Open neurosurgeries, on the other hand, are more traditional but still widely practiced for complex cases. Neuroendoscopy procedures involve the use of endoscopic tools for visualizing and treating conditions within the brain.

- **Technology:** Another key segmentation of the neurosurgery market is based on technology advancements. This includes navigation systems, neurostimulation devices, neurointerventional devices, and stereotactic radiosurgery systems. These technologies play a crucial role in improving surgical precision, reducing complications, and enhancing patient outcomes. Navigation systems, for instance, provide real-time imaging guidance during surgeries, while neurostimulation devices help in managing neurological disorders through targeted electrical stimulation.

- **Disease Indication:** The neurosurgery market can also be segmented based on the disease indications for which surgical interventions are required. This includes brain tumors, neurovascular diseases, traumatic brain injuries, spinal disorders, and others. Each indication requires specific surgical approaches and techniques tailored to the patient's condition. Brain tumors, for example, may require a combination of surgery, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy for effective treatment.
