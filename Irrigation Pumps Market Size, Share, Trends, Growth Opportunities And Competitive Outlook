**Segments**

- **Product Type**: The irrigation pumps market can be segmented based on the type of products offered, including centrifugal pumps, positive displacement pumps, and submersible pumps. Centrifugal pumps are widely used for irrigation purposes due to their ability to move large volumes of water efficiently. Positive displacement pumps, on the other hand, are suitable for applications that require a constant flow rate and high-pressure output. Submersible pumps are designed to be submerged in water, making them ideal for deep well irrigation systems.

- **Power Source**: Another important segmentation factor is the power source used for operating irrigation pumps. This includes electric pumps, diesel pumps, and solar pumps. Electric pumps are commonly used in areas with reliable electricity supply, offering consistent performance and efficiency. Diesel pumps are preferred in remote locations or areas with erratic power supply as they can operate independently of the grid. Solar pumps are gaining popularity due to their environmentally friendly and cost-effective operation.

- **Application**: The market can also be segmented based on application areas such as agriculture, residential, commercial, and industrial. Agriculture remains the largest segment driving the demand for irrigation pumps, particularly in regions with arid climates or limited access to water resources. The residential segment includes small-scale irrigation systems for gardens and landscaping purposes. Commercial and industrial applications require larger and more powerful pumps to ensure adequate water supply for landscaping, golf courses, or industrial processes.
