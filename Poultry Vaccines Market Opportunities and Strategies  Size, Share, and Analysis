**Segments**

- Type: The poultry vaccines market can be segmented based on type into inactivated vaccines, live attenuated vaccines, vector vaccines, subunit vaccines, DNA vaccines, and recombinant vaccines. Inactivated vaccines are created from inactivated or killed pathogens, providing immunity without causing the disease. Live attenuated vaccines contain weakened forms of the pathogens, stimulating a strong immune response. Vector vaccines use a weakened virus or bacterium as a ""vector"" to carry the immunizing antigens into the body. Subunit vaccines contain only the essential antigens necessary to produce an immune response. DNA vaccines use genetically engineered DNA to stimulate an immune response. Recombinant vaccines are created by inserting genetic material from the pathogen into another virus or bacterium.

- Disease Indication: The market can also be segmented by disease indication, including Newcastle disease, infectious bronchitis, avian influenza, Marek's disease, infectious bursal disease, and others. Each disease indication requires specific vaccines tailored to combat the particular pathogen causing the illness in poultry. For example, Newcastle disease is a highly contagious avian disease that requires specialized vaccines to prevent outbreaks and protect poultry populations. Marek's disease, caused by a herpesvirus, also necessitates targeted vaccination strategies to control its spread among birds.

- Route of Administration: Poultry vaccines can be categorized by the route of administration, such as subcutaneous, intramuscular, intranasal, and oral. The route of administration can impact the efficacy and convenience of vaccine delivery in poultry. Subcutaneous injections are commonly used for many poultry vaccines, providing a direct route for the vaccine to enter the bloodstream. Intramuscular injections may offer certain advantages in vaccine distribution and absorption. Intranasal and oral routes provide alternative methods of vaccine delivery that may be more practical for mass vaccination campaigns.
