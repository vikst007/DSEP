**Segments**

- **Product Type**: The market can be segmented by product type into flexible ureteroscopes and semi-rigid ureteroscopes. Flexible ureteroscopes are preferred for their ability to navigate the intricate anatomy of the urinary tract with minimal trauma, making them suitable for complex procedures. Semi-rigid ureteroscopes, on the other hand, are more rigid instruments that are typically used for simpler cases or where a firmer instrument is required for stone fragmentation.

- **Application**: In terms of application, the market can be segmented into diagnostic and therapeutic ureteroscopy. Diagnostic ureteroscopy involves the visual inspection of the urinary tract to identify issues such as stones, tumors, or other abnormalities. Therapeutic ureteroscopy, on the other hand, involves the treatment of these conditions through techniques like stone fragmentation, laser lithotripsy, or the removal of tissue growths.

- **End User**: The end-user segment includes hospitals, ambulatory surgical centers, and specialty clinics. Hospitals are the primary end users of ureteroscopy equipment due to the high volume of urinary stone cases they handle. Ambulatory surgical centers are gaining traction for their cost-effectiveness and convenience, particularly for less complex procedures. Specialty clinics may also utilize ureteroscopy equipment for specialized urological treatments.
