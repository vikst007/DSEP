**Segments**

- Based on type, the catheter coatings market can be segmented into hydrophilic coatings, antimicrobial coatings, drug-eluting coatings, and others. Hydrophilic coatings are widely used to reduce friction and improve the surface properties of catheters, making them easier to insert and maneuver within the body. Antimicrobial coatings help in preventing infections associated with catheter usage. Drug-eluting coatings are designed to slowly release medication to the catheter site, providing targeted treatment or prevention of certain conditions. The others segment includes specialty coatings with unique properties for specific applications.

- In terms of material, the catheter coatings market can be categorized into silicone, polyurethane, hydrophilic polymers, and others. Silicone coatings offer biocompatibility and lubricity, making them suitable for various catheter types. Polyurethane coatings provide durability and flexibility, enhancing the performance and longevity of catheters. Hydrophilic polymers improve the lubricity and surface interactions of catheters, especially in urinary or vascular applications. The others category encompasses emerging materials with specific functionalities for advanced catheter coatings.

- By application, the catheter coatings market covers cardiovascular, urology, neurovascular, general surgery, and others. Cardiovascular applications include catheters used in angioplasty, stent placement, and other cardiac procedures that benefit from specialized coatings. Urology applications involve catheters designed for urinary drainage, intermittent catheterization, and other urinary tract interventions. Neurovascular catheters are used in procedures like embolization, thrombectomy, and aneurysm coiling, requiring precise coatings for optimal performance. General surgery applications include a wide range of catheters used in procedures such as drainage, feeding, and tissue sampling. The others category comprises niche applications with specific coating requirements.
