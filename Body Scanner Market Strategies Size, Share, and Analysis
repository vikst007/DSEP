**Segments**

- Based on technology, the body scanner market can be segmented into millimeter-wave scanners, backscatter X-ray scanners, millimeter-wave scanners, and others. Millimeter-wave scanners are known for their non-invasive nature and are commonly used in airports and public places for security screening. Backscatter X-ray scanners use low-intensity X-rays to create detailed images of the body's surface and are often used in medical settings. The advancement in technology has led to the development of more sophisticated body scanners that offer higher accuracy and efficiency.

- In terms of product type, the body scanner market can be categorized into metal detectors, full-body scanners, and explosive trace detectors (ETD). Full-body scanners are increasingly being adopted in airports, seaports, and high-security facilities for comprehensive security screening. Metal detectors are commonly used in public spaces such as malls, cinemas, and events to detect metal objects on individuals. ETD devices are designed to detect explosive materials, providing an added layer of security in sensitive areas.

- The application segment of the body scanner market includes transport, critical infrastructure protection, border security, and others. The transport sector, especially airports, is a major end-user of body scanners to ensure passenger safety and security. Critical infrastructure protection involves the use of body scanners in facilities such as power plants, government buildings, and stadiums to prevent unauthorized access. Border security is another key application area where body scanners play a vital role in screening individuals and goods entering a country.
