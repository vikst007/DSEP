Celiac Disease Treatment Market is segmented based on diagnosis and treatment methods. In terms of diagnosis, blood tests, biopsy, and genetic testing are commonly utilized to confirm the presence of celiac disease in patients. Blood tests can screen for specific antibodies that indicate the body's response to gluten, while a biopsy involves examining small intestine tissue for damage characteristic of celiac disease. Genetic testing helps identify specific genetic markers associated with the condition. When it comes to treatment, the primary approach is a strict gluten-free diet. However, medications may be prescribed to manage symptoms or complications, and nutritional supplements are often recommended to address nutrient deficiencies. Immunotherapy is an emerging treatment option aimed at desensitizing patients to gluten exposure.
