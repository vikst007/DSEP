**Segments**

- **By Type:** The vapor recovery units market can be segmented based on type into activated carbon adsorption units, condensation units, membrane separation units, absorption units, and others. Activated carbon adsorption units are designed to capture hydrocarbon vapors from industrial processes and storage tanks. Condensation units use cooling technology to condense vapor into liquid form for recovery. Membrane separation units rely on membrane technology for the separation of vapors. Absorption units absorb vapors into a liquid solvent for recovery.

- **By Application:** In terms of application, the market can be categorized into upstream oil & gas facilities, downstream oil & gas facilities, landfills, chemical plants, and others. Upstream oil & gas facilities involve the extraction and production of oil and gas, where vapor recovery units are crucial for reducing emissions. Downstream oil & gas facilities include refineries and distribution terminals that also utilize VRUs to capture vapors. Landfills require VRUs to capture methane and other gases emitted during waste decomposition. Chemical plants use VRUs to recover volatile organic compounds (VOCs) from their processes.

- **By End-User:** The end-user segmentation of the vapor recovery units market includes oil & gas industry, chemical industry, landfills, pharmaceutical industry, and others. The oil & gas industry is the largest end-user of VRUs, given the significant amount of vapor emissions generated during extraction, processing, and distribution. Chemical plants employ VRUs to comply with environmental regulations and enhance operational efficiency. Landfill operators use VRUs to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions and odors. The pharmaceutical industry also adopts VRUs to control VOC emissions from manufacturing processes.
