**Segments**

- **By Type:** The agricultural films and bonding market can be segmented by type into high-density polyethylene (HDPE), low-density polyethylene (LDPE), ethylene-vinyl acetate (EVA), and others. HDPE films are widely used due to their excellent strength and durability, while LDPE films are preferred for their flexibility and impact resistance. EVA films are known for their high transparency and good adhesion properties, making them suitable for various applications in agriculture.

- **By Application:** In terms of application, the market can be divided into greenhouse films, mulch films, silage films, and others. Greenhouse films are designed to create an optimal environment for plant growth by trapping heat and controlling humidity. Mulch films help in weed control, moisture retention, and temperature regulation in the soil. Silage films are used for preserving forage crops by creating an airtight seal that protects them from spoilage.

- **By Bonding Type:** The bonding segment includes categories such as mechanical bonding, thermal bonding, and chemical bonding. Mechanical bonding involves interlocking components without the use of adhesives, providing strength and durability. Thermal bonding uses heat to melt the surfaces being bonded, creating a strong and permanent connection. Chemical bonding utilizes adhesives or glues to join materials together, offering flexibility and resistance to environmental conditions.
