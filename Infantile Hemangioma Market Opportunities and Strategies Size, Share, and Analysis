Infantile hemangiomas are the most common benign vascular tumors of infancy, typically presenting within the first few weeks of life. These tumors are characterized by rapid growth during the first year of life, followed by a spontaneous slow involution over several years. The global infantile hemangioma market is segmented based on type, treatment, and end-users.

In terms of type, the market is segmented into infantile hemangioma, common hemangioma, and others. Infantile hemangiomas are the most prevalent type and typically do not require treatment unless they are obstructing vision, breathing, or feeding. Common hemangiomas are usually smaller and less problematic than infantile hemangiomas.

Based on treatment, the market is divided into medication, laser therapy, surgery, and others. Medication is often the first-line treatment option for infantile hemangiomas, including beta-blockers and corticosteroids. Laser therapy and surgery may be considered for more severe or complicated cases.

The end-users of the infantile hemangioma market include hospitals, clinics, ambulatory surgical centers, and others. Hospitals are the primary point of care for patients with infantile hemangiomas, where they can receive comprehensive treatment and management.
