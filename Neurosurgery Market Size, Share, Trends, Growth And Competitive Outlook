**Segments**

The neurosurgery market can be segmented based on product type, application, and end-user. In terms of product type, the market is segmented into neurostimulation devices, neurointerventional devices, cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) management devices, neurosurgical navigation systems, neurosurgical instruments, and others. Neurostimulation devices include deep brain stimulation (DBS), spinal cord stimulation (SCS), and others. Neurointerventional devices encompass embolization coils, neurovascular stents, carotid artery stents, and others. CSF management devices consist of shunts and drainage systems. Neurosurgical navigation systems aid in accurate surgical navigation, while neurosurgical instruments include forceps, scalpels, and retractors, among others. The ""others"" category may include neuroendoscopes, stereotactic systems, and ultrasonic aspiration systems.

In terms of application, the neurosurgery market is segmented into spinal surgery, neurovascular surgery, oncological neurosurgery, and others. Spinal surgery involves the treatment of spinal cord injuries, deformities, and degenerative diseases. Neurovascular surgery deals with conditions affecting blood vessels in the brain and spinal cord. Oncological neurosurgery focuses on the treatment of brain and spinal tumors. The ""others"" category may include functional neurosurgery for movement disorders, epilepsy surgery, and trauma surgery.

Finally, based on end-user, the market is segmented into hospitals, ambulatory surgical centers, and specialty clinics. Hospitals are the primary end-users of neurosurgical products and services, as they cater to a wide range of neurosurgical procedures. Ambulatory surgical centers are gaining popularity for their convenience and cost-effectiveness in performing certain neurosurgical procedures. Specialty clinics offer specialized care for neurosurgical conditions and may have advanced equipment and expertise in specific neurosurgical areas.
