**Segments**

- **Product Type**: The laser probe market can be segmented based on the type of product, including handheld laser probes, fiber optic laser probes, and surgical laser probes. Handheld laser probes are suitable for point-of-care and mobile applications, offering convenience and versatility. Fiber optic laser probes enable precise delivery of laser energy to target tissues, making them ideal for minimally invasive procedures. Surgical laser probes are designed for use in operating rooms for cutting, coagulating, and ablating tissues.

- **Application**: Another important segmentation factor is the application of laser probes. This can include ophthalmology, dermatology, dentistry, cardiology, oncology, and others. Each application requires specific features and capabilities in laser probes to ensure optimum performance and efficacy. For example, ophthalmic laser probes need to deliver precise energy to treat eye conditions like retinal diseases, while dental laser probes must be able to effectively remove decayed tissues and treat gum diseases.

- **End User**: End users in the laser probe market can be segmented into hospitals and clinics, ambulatory surgical centers, specialty clinics, and research institutions. The choice of laser probe may vary depending on the setting where it will be used. Hospitals require versatile and reliable laser probes that can be used for a wide range of procedures, while specialty clinics may need specialized probes tailored to specific treatments. Research institutions may look for laser probes with advanced features for experimental studies.
