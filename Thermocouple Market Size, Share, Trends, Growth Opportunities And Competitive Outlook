- **Sensor Type:** The global thermocouple market can be categorized by sensor type into contact type temperature sensors and non-contact type temperature sensors. Contact type temperature sensors make direct contact with the object being measured, providing accurate and real-time temperature readings. On the other hand, non-contact type temperature sensors measure temperature from a distance without touching the object, suitable for applications where contact is not feasible or desired.

- **Metals:** Thermocouples are constructed using various metals to generate an electromotive force proportional to the temperature difference. Common metals used in thermocouple manufacturing include gold, copper, nickel, palladium, and platinum. Each metal combination offers different temperature ranges, accuracy levels, and resistance to environmental factors, catering to diverse industrial requirements.

- **Type:** The market offers different types of thermocouples based on the metal alloys used in their construction. Nickel-alloy thermocouples, tungsten/rhenium-alloy thermocouples, chromel-gold/iron-alloy thermocouples, and others provide distinct temperature measurement capabilities suitable for specific applications and environments. Each type of thermocouple has unique characteristics that determine its performance and suitability for different industries.

- **Product Type:** The global thermocouple market encompasses a range of product types, including Type J, Type K, Type T, Type N, Type E, Type B, Type R, and Type S thermocouples. Each product type is designed to meet specific
