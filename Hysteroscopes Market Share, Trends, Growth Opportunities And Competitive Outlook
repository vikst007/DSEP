**Segments**

- **Product Type**: The hysteroscopes market can be segmented based on product type into rigid hysteroscopes and flexible hysteroscopes.

- **Application**: Another crucial segmentation of the market is by application, which includes diagnostic hysteroscopy and operative hysteroscopy. Diagnostic hysteroscopy is primarily used for observing and diagnosing intrauterine abnormalities, while operative hysteroscopy involves performing surgical interventions within the uterine cavity, such as polyp removal or fibroid resection.
