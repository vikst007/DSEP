**Segments**

- **Technology**: The fiber optic gyroscope market can be segmented based on technology into interferometric fiber optic gyroscopes and resonant fiber optic gyroscopes. Interferometric fiber optic gyroscopes utilize the interference pattern generated by the light traveling in opposite directions in a coil of optical fiber to detect rotation rates. On the other hand, resonant fiber optic gyroscopes rely on the interaction between light and mechanical resonance modes within a coil of optical fiber.

- **Sensing Axis**: Another crucial segmentation of the fiber optic gyroscope market is based on the sensing axis, which can be either single-axis or multi-axis. Single-axis fiber optic gyroscopes measure rotation along a single axis, making them suitable for applications where rotation around one specific axis is the primary concern. Multi-axis fiber optic gyroscopes have the ability to measure rotation rates along multiple axes, providing more comprehensive motion sensing capabilities.

- **Application**: The market for fiber optic gyroscopes can also be segmented based on application areas. These include defense and aerospace, industrial, robotics, marine, automotive, and others. In the defense and aerospace sector, fiber optic gyroscopes are extensively used in navigation systems for aircraft, missiles, and spacecraft due to their high accuracy and reliability. In the industrial and robotics segments, fiber optic gyroscopes find applications in precision control systems and robotics for accurate motion sensing.
